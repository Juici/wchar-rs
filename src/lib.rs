//! This library introduces two macros [`wch`] and [`wchz`] to create UTF-16 or
//! UTF-32 wide strings at compiler time, like `L` string literals in C.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use wchar::{wch, wchz, wchar_t};
//!
//! // Equivalent to `#define RUST L"Rust"` in C.
//! const RUST: &[wchar_t] = wch!("Rust\0"); // C strings are nul-terminated.
//! // Equivalent to `#define ALSO_RUST L"Rust"` in C.
//! const ALSO_RUST: &[wchar_t] = wchz!("Rust");
//!
//! assert_eq!(RUST, &['R' as wchar_t, 'u' as wchar_t, 's' as wchar_t, 't' as wchar_t, 0x0000]);
//! assert_eq!(RUST, ALSO_RUST);
//! ```
